core functionality:
- standardize col names
- frontend dashboard for both modes
- make it so that you can pick what to log 
- pagination
- org mode
    - kubernetes deployment
    - kafka for high loads
    - users & devices (keycloak maybe)
hygiene: 
- standardize local/cache nomenclature
- make logger binary smaller
possible new features: 
- add get cache and get remote requests to api
- track currently running terminals? maybe currently running processes even? 
- encrypt logs
- log cmd outputs
- grafana logging
- autogen better postgres passwords
- add performant mode that doesn't call git status every time or maybe no git mode or just let users opt into what they want to log every time
- benchmarking?
