core functionality:
- standardize col names
- frontend dashboard for both modes
- possibly make delete and delete multiple return list of deleted entries?
- pagination
- add api
    - implement actual querying beyond list
    - add get logs list filters 
    - fix testing with api (cmd/server, cmd/client, etc...)
- org mode
    - dockerize, kubernetes deployment
    - kafka for high loads
    - users & devices (keycloak maybe)
hygiene: 
- track error handling better it gets silenced somewhere
- unit tests
- setup test docker image for test postgres db
- making logger binary smaller
- clean up .env file flow
- testing make targets
- check for duplicate event IDs ?
possible new features: 
- add get cache and get remote requests to api
- track currently running terminals? maybe currently running processes even? 
- add pause/resume logging functionality
- encrypt logs
- log cmd outputs
- grafana logging
- autogen better postgres passwords
- add performant mode that doesn't call git status every time or maybe no git mode or just let users opt into what they want to log every time
- benchmarking?
- add random dummy logs for testing
